## Welcome to the official Ara 3D team blog. 

I'm Christopher Diggins, the founder of Ara 3D. 
I've been writing about technology for many years. 
I've contributed to several different blogs 

This blog will be a bit different than my previous. 

Rather than just focusing on technology I am also going 
to share my adventures, inspirations, and interactions (both 
of the two-legged kind and the four-legged kind).

As I've grown older I've come to recognize the importance 
of my interactions and experiences. 

The things that shapes and form us, and bring us to where we 
are today, is just as important as our achievements or 
contributions. 

Like the cliche says, its the journey, not the destination. 

I am going to be sharing this space with the Ara 3D 
team, my partners in crime, partners, friends, and other 
guests. 

I wanted this to be a place to archive our ideas, experiences,
and project in one place, and in a format that we find 
fun and useful. 

## So, what to expect? 

Deep technical articles, experiments, ideas, musings, feelings.  

## Thoughts on Writing

As a child I learned programming in the 80's through 
books and magazines. 

There weren't many programming books available, but I 
devoured every book I could find. 

It started with just copying source code for programs,
but then I started modifying the code to see what would happen. 

One day I got my hands on a magazine called Doctor Dobbs Journal (DDJ). 

It opened my eyes to the fact that there were more languages
and technologies out there than I could ever imagine.

For many years it was a dream that some day I would have an 
article published in DDJ. I had my first article published in the August 2004 issue.
Afterwards I contributed dozens of articles to Doctor Dobbs Journal and the C++ Users
Journal, and even became a regular columnist:

Writing is a fun activity for me, but it is also a tool.

A way of quieting and focusing the mind. 

Providing structure to my thoughts, feelings, and ideas 
which are always swirling in my mind. 

If I can write about something, it gives it form and clarity. 

It becomes easier for me to find useful and practical ideas. 

## Back to Blogging

I've contribute to several blogs over the years. 

The Artima.com community was very important to me. 

It was a great opportunity to be in virtual proximity with giants of technology 
Martin Odersky, Martin Fowler, Guido van Rossum, Michael Feathers.  

## What's in a Blog? 

I'm looking forward to not only sharing my thoughts, 
ideas, and projects but also collaborate with the Ara 3D team as well as my friends and partners.
