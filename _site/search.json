It’s not just about facts and deliverables, it’s also about the human (or canine) journey behind them.So yes, I’ll still be posting technical deep-dives, lessons, and experimental findings. But I’ll also be sharing more personal stories: my inspirations, my adventures, and my interactions both with the two-legged kind and the four-legged kind-as a technologist,entrepreneur, maneuvering the complex world of neurotypicals for half a century.This blog is a shared space. You’ll also be hearing from the Ara 3D team, our partners, our friends, and our guests.We’re building this as a living archive: a place for documenting our adventures, learnings, ideas, stories, and projects - written in a voice that’s uniquely ours.Thanks for being here. 🤗",
