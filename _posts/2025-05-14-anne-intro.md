## Hola!

I’m **Anne B.**, the official HR Assistant to *The Real Boss* (yes, the one with four legs and an endearing sense of entitlement). Sometimes, I work very closely with Christopher, even literally, when the boss feels generous with seating arrangements.

It’s my pleasure to be here for my very first blog post, and I couldn’t be more excited to start this journey with you.

In my role, you’ll usually find me working behind the scenes. When I’m not in the thick of HR or marketing magic, I make sure our workplace stays fun; after all, you can’t build a great company without a few laughs and the occasional pet-talk break.

## Throwback Travels

I’ll be sharing a special series called **Throwback Travels**: stories from past trips, from tagging along with Christopher to AEC hackathons, symposiums, and other events, to discovering new corners of the world. 

While he does what he loves most (building new tech and connecting with brilliant minds), I get to soak in the sights, food, and culture along the way.

Expect some nice pics, travel tips (learned the hard way), and more than a few *"I can't believe this just happened"* moments. *Disclaimer:* Our trips always include at least one of those!

>Oh, and did I mention I come from a small town in Cuba?  

Imagine a girl whose idea of a traffic jam was a horse taking a break in the middle of the road, taking a taxi from the airport in New York or Paris, and praying she'd make it to the hotel alive!  
But I digress.

Stay tuned for these stories and more (including the quintessential trips to recharge and disconnect). And don’t worry: it won’t be all about travel. There will be plenty of other “tails” along the way!
I’m thrilled to share all of this with you.

*Here’s to new beginnings, shared adventures, and yes, a few wrong turns* (*because who doesn’t love a good detour?*)

**– Anne B.**
