**Allo! I‚Äôm Bernie, the Real Boss at Ara 3D.**  
This is my very first blog post, and as someone who takes posts seriously, I‚Äôm so excited!

## **How It All Started**

I joined the team in 2020 at just 8 weeks old. Inexperienced and still figuring out stairs? Sure. But they were desperate to fill the position.  
And I had that leadership presence you just can‚Äôt train.  

A few candidates were considered, but my CV stood out. (There was definitely some beauty bias involved.)  

The job offer was irresistible: open-air office, catered meals, VIP travel, chauffeur service, full medical coverage, spa services, and the unbeatable perks of 24/7 staff support and total respect. A dream package!  

Long story short, I left the office I‚Äôd briefly shared with a loud miniature human and headed off to my new adventure. Woof!

## **The Ruff Beginnings**

I won't lie, though. The early days at Ara 3D were a bit *ruff*.  
The team expected me to follow their lead, even if I had been hired to lead them.  

They also wanted me to understand the office jargon on Day One. And sure, that was super easy. But I decided to pretend I didn‚Äôt understand words like "Drop" or "Come."  

It took a bit of time (and a lot of patience) for them to accept it:  
**I am The Boss. I do not "Come."**  
Still TRUE (‚úîÔ∏è).  
Well‚Ä¶ give me a treat, and I may.

## **Leading by Example (and by Leash)**

Another huge challenge was the walks, my top prescription for a happy mind and a productivity boost.  
The team needed serious help. Having packed some extra Covid pounds, they had to be motivated to get back in shape.  

It was exhausting work. They walked slower than Cuban WiFi.  

I had to pull them all the time, all while teaching them the finer things in life:

- Smell the flowers  
- Breathe in the breeze  
- (OK, maybe don‚Äôt eat the butterflies)  
- Greet everyone with *you-are-the-best-person-ever* enthusiasm!

They have improved, but it‚Äôs still a work in progress.

## **Looking Back (With Tail Wags)**

Looking back, those early days were wild! So glad they believed in me and hired me to do what I do best:  
**Boosting the team‚Äôs morale and building a culture where walkies, Zoom(ies), and vacations are always a priority.**

Can‚Äôt wait to share more with you!  
Put on your harness for more adventures and behind-the-scenes Ara 3D *tails*, as we chase dreams (or balls!) and shake up the future of the AEC field.  

**Hasta pronto, amigos!**
