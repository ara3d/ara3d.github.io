## Welcome to the official Ara 3D team blog. 

Welcome to our team blog!

I'm Christopher Diggins, the founder of Ara 3D.

My blog on this site will be a little different from my previous forays into blogging (on sites like Artima.com, Dr. Dobb's, Microsoft, O'Reilly, Autodesk Area).

As I've grown older, I've come to better appreciate the importance of storytelling - offering context for the explorations, creations, and learnings. It's not just about facts and deliverables, it's also about the human (or canine) journey behind them.

So yes, I'll still be posting technical deep-dives, lessons, and experimental findings. But I'll also be sharing more personal stories: my inspirations, my adventures, and my interactions both with the two-legged kind and the four-legged kind-as a technologist,entrepreneur, maneuvering the complex world of neurotypicals for half a century. 

This blog is a shared space. You'll also be hearing from the Ara 3D team, our partners, our friends, and our guests. 

We're building this as a living archive: a place for documenting our adventures, learnings, ideas, stories, and projects - written in a voice that's uniquely ours. 

Thanks for being here. ðŸ¤—
