  about_description: >
    Meet the brains (and paws) behind this blog:

    Christopher Diggins, founder and CEO, is our fearless leader in all things code and chaos. 
    Fueled by caffeine, he's always pushing boundaries in the AEC world.

    Anne B., my loyal HR Assistant and Marketing Enthusiast, holds an M.A. from Concordia U.
    and a PhD in the fine art of 'adapt or laugh' (third-world edition). She's passionate about 
    chess, writing, and plotting the next travel adventure.

    And then there's me: The Real Boss. I run on naps, sunshine, and a strict policy of barking at cows 
    (don't question it). I keep team morale high and priorities in order: snacks, joy, then work.

    This blog is your backstage pass to our world. Stick around: We have stories to tell!
