# About Us

Ara 3D is a Montreal based start-up specializing in 3D software development. We develop tools, plug-ins, and libraries for end-users or license use in other libraries.   

Ara 3D has unique insights and experience in the domain of processing 3D data in an efficient manner and creating tools that provide unprecedented creative flexibility to the user.  

## Our specialties:

* 3D data processing 
* Cross-language development (C#, C++, Python, JavaScript)
* Programming language design and implementation (text-based and visual)
* Development of libraries, SDKs, and APIs   

# R&D

## Current Projects

We are currently working on plug-ins for Revit and 3ds Max:

1. Revit FBX and OBJ Exporters   
2. Volumetric toolkit for 3ds Max based on OpenVDB
3. Particle and instancing system for 3ds Max 
4. Tools for exporting BIM data from Revit and importing into 3ds
 Max

We have also been doing some research into GPU acceleration in JavaScript. 

## Technology Stack 

We are building a multi-language technology stack for 3D data processing that is second to none. Like any successful technology company our foundation is a number of high quality proven open-source libraries (e.g. OpenVDB, Assimp, System.Numerics, geometry3sharp, Three.JS, OpenEXR, etc.). 

In order to build tools that surpass our customer's expectations we identified a need for some foundational low-level libraries that we are building as open-source libraries. 

* LinqArray - A C# library for efficient processing of immutable array data structures 
* Math3D - A C# library of basic data structures and 3D vector math 
* FGeometry - A C# library for 3D geometry manipulation
* array_h - A C++ library for working with containers of data in contiguous memory  
* BFAST - A data/file format for storing arrays of binary data  

## Why Open-Source? 

Ara 3D does has a valuable core set of closed source IP that is built from our unique insights and experience based on decades of experience working in software development. 

We have chosen to open-source low-level libraries (e.g. math, geometry, and array processing) because it gives our clients, partners, investors, and ourselves confidence that the libraries we are building on top of are the best quality they can be. This is because we benefit from the scrutiny and contributions of the open-source community. This is key for our fast development turn-around. 

# Our Team 

Ara 3D was founded by Christopher Diggins. He has over 20 years of software development experience from launching a small profitable e-commerce startup to working at Microsoft. 

From 2008 to 2017 Christopher worked for at Autodesk where he worked on the 3ds Max team as a principal engineer and lead the effort to develop the MCG visual programming environment. 

Christopher was co-author of The C++ Cookbook for O'Reilly and his published numerous articles on software development.
